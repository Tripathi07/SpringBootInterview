This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, Welcome to CUBA!`" RESTful web
service with Spring.

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/greeting`.

It will respond with a JSON representation of a greeting, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, Welcome to CUBA!"}
----
====

You will further customize the greeting with an optional name parameter in the query string, like
the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=Tripathi
----
====

The name parameter value overrides the default value of "Welcome to CUBA !" and is reflected in the response, like

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello,  Welcome to CUBA ! Tripathi !! ""}
----
====

With multiple request, value of ID should be autoincremented
